## Project Title
-This project analyzed the end-to-end supply chain performance for a mid-sized manufacturing company, with a focus on optimizing inventory levels, reducing supplier lead times, and improving order fulfillment rates.

### Focus Areas
#Inventory Management

-Analyzed stock turnover ratio and days of inventory on hand (DOH)

-Identified overstocked and understocked SKUs

-Forecasted seasonal demand using historical sales data

#Supplier Performance

-Measured on-time delivery (OTD) by supplier

-Tracked lead time variability

-Flagged high-risk suppliers with frequent delays

#Logistics Efficiency

-Assessed average transportation time by region

-Evaluated cost per shipment and fulfillment rate

-Identified bottlenecks in the last-mile delivery process

#Demand Forecast Accuracy

-Compared forecast vs actual demand to assess planning accuracy

-Visualized forecast error trends across SKUs

### Key Insights:
-40% of inventory value was tied up in low-turnover SKUs, indicating a need for SKU rationalization.

-Supplier A had a 22% late delivery rate, directly impacting production cycles.

-Introducing safety stock policies for high-variance items reduced stockouts by 18%.

-Re-routing shipments through a central warehouse reduced delivery time by 2 days on average.
